      <description>Welcome Welcome to the first post of my blog, aethers-vi, in which I will talk about the different complaints and problems I&amp;rsquo;ve been having working with Hugo along with Github Pages for the past 3 days, as well as explain some of the solutions I found useful for the problem I was having. I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you in advance, it&amp;rsquo;s been hell.
Problems Lack of documentation Since the start of my journey trying to start this blog and post for the world for the first time, I&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling with the fact that paying for a server is too expensive for a blog which will be managed by one person only, So I went to explore other alternatives that could offer me something more accessible.</description>
