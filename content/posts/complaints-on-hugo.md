## Welcome

Welcome to the first post of my blog, aethers-vi, in which I will explain the different complaints and problems
I've been having working with Hugo along with Github Pages for the past 3 days. I'll tell you in advance, it's
been hell for me. 

## Lack of documentation

Since the start of my journey trying to start this blog and post for the world for the first time, I've been
struggling with the fact that paying for a server is too expensive for a blog which will be managed by one person 
only, So I went to explore other alternatives that could offer me something more accessible. That's how I learned
about static websites generators.

I came across many static website generators, including Next.js, Jekyll and Hugo, the last one being the one I'm
to make this blog right now. 

Since Hugo seemed interesting and looked like a tool which wasn't going to be that much of a trouble to 
deploy a website and start working on my blog and my social media presence, I decided to give it a shot which
lasted three entire days of sorrow and suffering.

After installing Hugo on my laptop, I followed the steps to create a new site, create a new post, push it to 
a Github repo and host it using Github Pages. This is where hell starts.

When the site was deployed, it was supposed to load the content and the theme correctly, which means the HTML
and CSS of the time. What an unpleasant surprise for me that only the HTML was loading on the site. 

After seeing this, I decided to do what every software developer would do in a situation like this: Google. 
I'm lying, I first tried to troobleshoot it myself and then googled it. 

After searching through Google for an hour and trying every single solution here was, I started to get desperate. 
I even tried looking up different tutorials that tried different approaches to hosting a Hugo site on Github
Pages. This didn't work at all, since it was working for everyone and not for me. I started to even think that
there had to be a problem with the version of Hugo I had installed, or with the blog.
